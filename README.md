# Capgemini Repository
Repo of code for Capgemini. This is a repo of code extracts from the working repo found here: https://github.com/scott1541/Capgemini-Working 

# In this repo:

# JavaScript Folder
  A few examples of JavaScript class work
 Â 
# Haskell_to_Scala files
  A series of tasks converting haskell code from learnyouahaskell.com to Scala equivalent code.
  Primarily my own implementations but some inbuilt functions used and help from other sources.
  
# 99 Scala Problems
  Another series of tasks completing a handful of challenges in Scala, 1 - 15 completed here.
  
# Other scala/sc files
  Various examples of code implemented for class work, including the atbash cipher and number translator
  
# Scala Play folder
  This folder contains class work using the scala play framework, and an 'in progress' implementation of a mongoDB database
  
 # MPG Calculator folder
  This folder contains an as of yet incomplete small GUI application that I've been experimenting with on and off over the past week or so. Unfinished yet as its low priority.
